    title: "Pomodoro Timer",
    description: `A Pomodoro timer is a time management tool designed to enhance productivity by breaking work into manageable intervals, traditionally 25 minutes long, called "Pomodoros", separated by short breaks. This method, known as the Pomodoro Technique, was developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The name "Pomodoro", meaning "tomato" in Italian, comes from the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used during his university studies.`,
